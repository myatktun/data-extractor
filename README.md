Just learning python by solving my own real world problems.

## Pyenv and Python LSP Server

For pylsp to work with pyenv virtual environment, just set local pyenv version to both virtual
environment version and global version, by editing `.python-version` file or

```
pyenv local <global_version> <venv_version>
```
